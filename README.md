# Project-1

Currently studying Front End Development and hopefully will get my certification in August. The online course is with The Learning People Global and they cover a significant
amount of courses that can be done in your own time and online. 
My first project is a basic portfolio about myself and there are guidelines to follow for this part of the course.
I feel the course is well done but can be difficult sometimes especially if there is a problem that is hard to resolve. Working full time and having family makes it even harder 
but my interest in Software Design and Front End programming has increased since I started the course.
The webpage will be quite basic as I have only covered off on HTML and CSS and a little bit of Javascript but like anything, experience and exposure is all that is required
and I will get there. Enjoy the page, feel free to comment or advise ways of changing things if you view this project. I am learning and happy to be guided in any way.
Enjoy!
